{"name":"Marvin","tagline":"A cute and keyboard-smashingly hard desktop platformer","body":"![](http://imgur.com/QmlEBRJ)\r\n\r\n### About\r\nMarvin is a desktop platformer I developed in C++ using the Box2D physics library, and SFML. I drew a fair bit of inspiration from Super Meat Boy in the sense that the game has an innocent feel to it, but is still meant to be challenging. As of now Marvin is still under development; I'm always looking for suggestions and improvements to make. What are you waiting for? Give it a try! \r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nAs of now Marvin is only playable on Windows. The game is pre-built and is packaged in a .zip file which you can download above! Just extract and click on the executable inside. If you're curious about the backbone of the game, the source code is publicly available on my GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Attributions\r\nSpecial thanks to Kenny (http://kenney.nl/) for providing absolutely wonderful free assets!\r\nAlso thanks to Foaly (@Foaly) for providing an Animated Sprite and Animation class, [Xelu](http://opengameart.org/users/xelu) for keyboard prompts, and [rezoner](http://opengameart.org/users/rezoner) and [OveMelaa](http://opengameart.org/users/ovemelaa) for the great music!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFound a bug?
